        <h1>What is a project overview?</h1>
        <p>A project overview is an outline of a project that describes important details about it. A project overview includes basic information, such as the project name, project manager, and sponsors. It also includes detailed information that summarizes the project's value, the problem it may solve, and the goals the team hopes to achieve. Project overviews are typically one page or less, as they're a summary of the project. Project managers tend to include the project overview at the beginning of a proposal or project plan to introduce the reader to the topic. Project managers create a project overview before the project begins to convince senior management that the project is necessary. They may also create a project overview to ensure their team understands the project's goals and objectives. This keeps the team organized and gives them something to refer to throughout the project.</p>
